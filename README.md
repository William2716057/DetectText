# Text Detection and Recognition with EasyOCR

This Python project demonstrates text detection and recognition using the EasyOCR library. EasyOCR is a deep learning-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool that can detect and recognize text in images with high accuracy.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless easyocr matplotlib numpy

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd your-repo
Replace 'PATHTOFILE' in the imagePath variable in the code with the actual path to the image you want to process.

Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python text_detection_recognition.py
This will detect text in the specified image and display it with bounding boxes and text annotations for recognized text regions.

Configuration
You can customize the behavior of the script by adjusting parameters such as the language used for OCR and the confidence threshold for text recognition. These settings can be modified in the script itself.

Feel free to contribute to this project or provide feedback. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please create an issue in the GitHub repository.

Happy text detection and recognition!
