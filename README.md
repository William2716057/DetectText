# Text Detection and Recognition with EasyOCR

This Python project demonstrates text detection and recognition using the EasyOCR library. EasyOCR is a deep learning-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool that can detect and recognize text in images with high accuracy.
It will detect text in the specified image and display it with bounding boxes and text annotations for recognized text regions.



##Configuration
You can customize the behavior of the script by adjusting parameters such as the language used for OCR and the confidence threshold for text recognition. These settings can be modified in the script itself.
